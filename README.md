<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<b>Thunder fighter</b>  (based on Android). You must have played tank battle or airplane battle when you were young. Everyone has memories of childhood. Therefore, based on the original old version of the Thunder fighter, our new version of the game will be smoother and more comfortable. As a game player, you need to control your own aircraft from being hit by local fighters. If you are hit multiple times, you will lose the game qualification. The longer you persist, the more powerful you are.
